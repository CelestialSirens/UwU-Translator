The UwU C++ Translator


Idea is change any user input to UwU language. Basically means replacing any 'L', 'R' letters used into 'W' and then outputing the result.

Super simple but then I want it to go from just being a local client side thing to a client - server thing that outputs the result from a server instead of just via terminal.

Eventually I may make a front end version of this or simply just make it into a webapp that i would make a front end page and then pass this all through either Javascript or PHP instead of just C / C++
